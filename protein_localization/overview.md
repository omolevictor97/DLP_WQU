### Project Overview

This project introduces learners to multiclass classification using the Yeast dataset, a bioinformatics dataset involving 10 classes. Through four structured notebooks, learners explore new loss functions, optimization techniques, and evaluation metrics. They also investigate strategies for improving generalization, such as regularization, while tackling issues like class imbalance.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

- Implementing multiclass classification with PyTorch
- Applying softmax activation and Cross-Entropy loss
- Evaluating models using confusion matrices and per-class accuracy
- Experimenting with optimizers (GD, SGD, mini-batch)
- Applying regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 to combat overfitting
