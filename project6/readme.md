# Project Overview

This project deepens students’ experience with convolutional architectures by exploring Transfer Learning and Advanced CNNs. Using the Plant Seedlings Classification dataset, students work with real-world images of plants to learn how to build resilient models in the face of visual variability like lighting, angles, and background noise. The project focuses on modern strategies for improving training efficiency and model generalization, including fine-tuning pre-trained models and applying data augmentation techniques. This transition prepares learners to tackle production-ready image classification tasks using cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

Some of the things you'll learn are: <br>

- Training a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch for multiclass image classification
- Applying Transfer Learning by adapting pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet18) to new datasets
- Understanding the tradeoffs between training from scratch and fine-tuning pre-trained architectures
- Using data augmentation to improve generalization and model robustness
- Evaluating models using confusion matrices, per-class accuracy, and visual error analysis
