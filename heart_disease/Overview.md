### Project Overview

Building on the foundation laid in Project 1, this project guides learners through the core concepts and implementation of simple neural networks. Beginning with the perceptron algorithm, learners explore how neurons form networks, implement both forward and backward passes manually, and then use PyTorch to train and evaluate their models. The Heart Disease dataset provides practice with binary classification and helps learners understand the impact of model structure, non-linearity, and optimization.

Some of the things you'll learn are:
* Implementing a perceptron from scratch and understand its limitations
* Developing intuition for feedforward neural networks and activation functions
* Manually computing gradients using the chain rule and apply weight updates
* Training and evaluating neural networks using PyTorch tools
* Using loss functions and optimizers relevant to classification tasks
* Exploring the implications of model complexity and overfitting
