### Project Overview

> Building on multiclass classification, this project introduces deep neural networks using the CIFAR-10 image dataset. Learners explore the training challenges of deeper architectures, including initialization, optimization strategies, and stabilization techniques. The project concludes with simplified implementations of LeNet and AlexNet to transition into CNNs in the next project.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

- Training deep MLPs and understand the limitations of fully connected models for image data
- Using initialization methods to improve deep model training
- Comparing optimizers like SGD and Adam in practice
- Stabilizing training with Batch Normalization and regularization
- Implementing simplified CNN architectures and compare them with MLPs
