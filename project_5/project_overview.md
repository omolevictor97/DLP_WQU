### Project Overview

This project marks the transition from fully connected networks to convolutional architectures, equipping students with the core tools for computer vision tasks. Using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, learners explore how convolutional layers extract spatial patterns and textures from image data. Students will implement, train, and evaluate their first CNNs, and reflect on their performance relative to deep MLPs. The project concludes with a structural introduction to foundational CNNs like LeNet and VGG, preparing the ground for advanced vision architectures in the next module.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

- Understanding convolutional operations and how they differ from dense layers
- Building, training, and evaluating basic CNNs in PyTorch
- Analyzing classification performance using visual tools and confusion matrices
- Comparing custom CNNs to simplified versions of LeNet and VGG
- Interpreting architectural design choices and how they affect learning from images
